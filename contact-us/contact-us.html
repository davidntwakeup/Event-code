                            additional conditions of admission to the event.</li>
                        <li>Ticket holders buy the event ticket at will. Mtickets will not be responsible loss, damage
                            or injury arising from a pre-existing medical condition or due to breach of these
                            conditions.</li>
                        <li>Advertised programs may be varied without notice. Artists may be added, withdrawn or
                            substituted for performances and the right to vary prices, venues, seating arrangements and
                            audience capacity is reserved by the Glasshouse and hirers.</li>
                        <li>Prices are subject to change without notice.
                            Tickets are subject to no refund or exchange. In some instances such as cancelled events
                            refunds for performance tickets may be reversable in accordance with the agreement with the
                            event owner. Exchanges of tickets, or the replacement of lost, stolen or missing allocated
                            seating tickets may be permitted under certain conditions and fees may apply. General
                            Admission tickets will not be reissued.</li>
                        <li>Mtickets reserves the right to charge transaction fees for bookings in addition to the
                            standard ticket price as well as administration fees for tasks such as ticket exchanges,
                            ticket reissues and other associated administrative tasks.</li>
                        <li>Bookings are subject to availability and no guarantee is made that specific seating requests
                            will be available at time of booking.</li>
                        <li>Where an age restriction or recommendation applies to an event, patrons will be advised
                            accordingly. Under 18’s will not be permitted admission to an event that is Restricted 18+.

                        <li>Terms and conditions remain in effect even when the ticket changes hands. The reselling of a
                            ticket or a breach of the terms and conditions, does not nullify the terms and conditions of
                            the original ticket sale. Any subsequent ticket holder is bound by those terms and
                            conditions.</li>

                            any other cause reasonably beyond the Mtickets’s control, there is no right of refund or
                            exchange, and no obligation is assured by Mtickets for the arranging of a substitute
